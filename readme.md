# wnfs-go

go language implementation of the fission [web-native file system](https://whitepaper.fission.codes/file-system/file-system-basics), using the [typescript implementation](http://github.com/fission-suite/webnative) as a reference.

### Development Status: Work-In-Progress
This repo is very much a work-in-progress, and doesn't yet produce proper WNFS data. Don't rely on this.

### Security Status: Insecure
This repo has the beginnings of an implementation of a private, encrypted-at-rest filesystem. It is **not** finished and is  **not** reliable for keeping your data secure. Don't use this to store private data until this message is removed.
